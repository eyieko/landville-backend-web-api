## Setup

- Step by step instructions on how to get the code setup locally. This may include:

    ### Description:
- _Celery_ is a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling.
- _Redis_ is a message broker. This means it handles the queue of "messages" between Django and Celery.
- All two work together to make real-time magic.
- This module contains the Celery application instance for this project, we take configuration from Django settings and use autodiscover_tasks to find task modules inside all packages listed in INSTALLED_APPS.

    ### Installing requirements
The settings file assumes that rabbitmq-server is running on localhost using the default ports.

### Dependencies

    - python3.7
    - python3
    - pip3
    - django 2.2.1
    - celery
    - redis

### Getting Started

- First clone the project to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/landvilleng/landville-backend-web-api.git`
- Create a virtual environment using the following command : `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
- Activate your virtual environment using `source (virtualenv name)/bin/activate`
- Create a new branch from the develop branch using the command `git checkout -b your_branch_name`
- Install project requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- To create a dot_env file `.env`, run the command `cp .env_sample .env` so that the `.env_sample` file can be copied to `.env`.
- Edit the `.env` file with your own credentials. Eg : database username, password ,etc
- Set your environement variable by running the following command `source .env`
- Create a Postgres database with the name you put in the `.env` file
- Run the command `python manage.py migrate` to create database tables
- Download Redis
    * Using Homebrew:  ```$ brew install redis```
    * Start Redis server  ```$ brew services start redis ```
- Open & Test Redis:
	```$ redis-server```
- Run worker:
	```
	$ celery -A yourproject worker -l info`
	```
	* example 
	```
	$ celery -A landville worker -l info
	```
- Run command `python manage.py runserver` to start the project
